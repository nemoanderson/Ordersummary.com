### #100DayofCode

https://www.100daysofcode.com/
To keep motivated, I remembered about #100DayofCode which can keep me motivated and possibly inform people of my skills I'm developing for a job in coding websites.

- Two Main Rules
  1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
  2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

The goal is to build a portfolio to show for a job and to network with individuals that share love of coding.


## Notes

I added all the elements via HTML and following along with the video. I added a div that has a card class added. Now we are going to give the div a width and height
